# Spacecraft Pressure Valve Health
# Improving PHM Technology for Spacecraft Propulsion Systems

## Project Overview
This project aims to enhance Prognostics and Health Management (PHM) technologies for spacecraft propulsion systems. Developed as part of the ENME691 Industrial AI course at the University of Maryland, this study uses telemetry data and a numerical simulator to predict the dynamic response of spacecraft propulsion systems, focusing on fault detection, classification, localization, and severity assessment.

### Objectives
- Develop a robust diagnostic framework for propulsion systems focusing on fault localization and classification.
- Utilize high-fidelity data combined with advanced diagnostic procedures to handle the complexities of spacecraft propulsion defect identification and classification.

## Repository Contents
- `Data/`: Folder containing training and test datasets.
- `Scripts/`: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and model training.
- `Notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and visualization.
- `Results/`: Output files including classification reports and model performance metrics.
- `docs/`: Additional documentation and project reports.
