# Vibration Data Analysis with DTW and SVM

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing vibration data using Dynamic Time Warping (DTW) and Support Vector Machines (SVM) to classify mechanical states of equipment. It involves reading data from CSV files, preprocessing it, applying DTW for similarity measurements, and using SVM for classification. The dataset includes vibration data under different mechanical conditions, categorized as Healthy, Unbalanced Level 1, and Unbalanced Level 2.

## Features
- **Dynamic Time Warping**: Application of DTW to measure the similarity between time series data under varying time speeds.
- **Support Vector Machines**: Use of SVM to classify the data into different mechanical states based on extracted features.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling and preparation of time series data from CSV files for analysis.
- **Feature Extraction**: Extraction of meaningful features from vibration data to feed into the SVM classifier.
- **Visualization**: Visualization of training and test results for comprehensive analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or newer
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn
- fastdtw

### Installation
Clone this repository and install the required Python libraries:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/vibration-analysis-dtw-svm.git
cd vibration-analysis-dtw-svm
pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib scikit-learn fastdtw
Usage
Run the main script to process the vibration data, perform DTW, extract features, and classify the data using SVM:

bash
Copy code
python vibration_analysis.py
Data
The project uses vibration data collected under different conditions:

Healthy
Unbalanced Level 1
Unbalanced Level 2
The data is expected in CSV format located in specific directories within the project folder.

Results
The results include:

DTW distance calculations between test and training data.
SVM classification output.
Plots of time-domain signals and frequency-domain FFT results.
Accuracy measurements and confusion matrices.
Results are displayed in plots generated by Matplotlib and can be directly viewed during script execution.
